sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It takes the least time in going through the sorted numbers which makes sense if it's bubble sort since its omega of n.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It goes through the 50000 number long randomized order the fastest.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It's consistent in how long it takes to go through the numbers no matter the order of the least which makes sense since selection sort is theta of n squared.
